### Description of game

  It is a choose your own adventure, where you choose your role and your path to vanquish the Anomaly.
  
  The game was initially designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly [V1.0.0](https://github.com/Aloyleow/3Endventure-Game). Upon graduation i decided to change the stack of the game, utilising both backend and frontend with user authentication.

  I decided to stick with the initial "- Game required features" under V1.0.0 MVP which is three end points are required, thus the game name. RNG elements in fights are now more stable and i decided to changed options to choose fights to options to choose path instead. I have also introduced a new feature where users are able to use items. Enjoy your time playing!
